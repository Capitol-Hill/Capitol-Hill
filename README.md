# Capitol Hill
Capitol Hill is an application designed to easily connect people with their Senators and Congressional representatives, and to keep constituents up to date with their representative’s legislative actions. Users can search for their district’s representatives, or state Senators, and will be returned with that politician’s contact information and voting track record. Users can also search by a map, which has each Congressional district, and can find representatives through this method.
